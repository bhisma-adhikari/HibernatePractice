- This project illustrates the use of Hibernate ORM for CRUD operations on database. 
- DDL for the sample database (hibernate_practice) is included as DDL.sql file. Executing this script will generate the schema only (tables and relationships). This won't populate the tables with any data.  
- This database is designed to contain all possible relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany) in order to illustrate the use of Hibernate in each one of these scenarios.
